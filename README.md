## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My cleanest Javascript project thus far on Frontend Mentor. Completed under 12 hours. Pretty much knew how to handle expected javascript effects, plus the searches to work around the CSS and HTML gave quick results.  

### Continued development

The reward for hardwork is more work. We move!
